Phase 2: Data Exploration & Understanding (Day 2-3)
Key Features to Analyze

Target Variable: Price
Categorical Features:

Brand/Make (Toyota, Honda, BMW, etc.)
Model (Camry, Civic, X3, etc.)
Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid)
Transmission (Manual, Automatic)
Owner Type (First, Second, Third+)
Location/City


Numerical Features:

Year of Manufacture
Kilometers Driven / Mileage
Engine Size (CC)
Max Power (bhp)
Seating Capacity
Age of Car (calculated)

Phase 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Common Data Issues in Car Datasets
1. Missing Values Strategy
2. Outlier Detection & Treatment
3. Data Type Corrections
4. Feature Engineering


Phase 4: Model Building & Comparison (Day 6-8)
Models to Implement & Compare
1. Linear Regression (Baseline)
2. Ridge Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
5. Model Training Pipeline


Phase 5: Model Evaluation & Analysis (Day 9-10)
Evaluation Metrics

1. RÂ² Score: How much variance is explained (higher is better)
2. RMSE: Root Mean Square Error in dollars (lower is better)
3. MAE: Mean Absolute Error in dollars (lower is better)
4. MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (lower is better)

Phase 6: Model Deployment & Presentation
Create Interactive Web App
